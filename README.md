# PostgreSQL
PostgreSQL, a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS), and PostGIS, a spatial extension for PostgreSQL that allows the user to store and spatially query geographic data. Both PostgreSQL and PostGIS are free and open-source software.

In this, we will install PostgreSQL and the PostGIS extension, then load spatial data stored as a CSV and as a Shapefile into the database. Finally, we'll run a few spatial queries that demonstrate some of its functionality. Create a database containing Coffee Shops and Neighborhoods in the city of Cambridge. Once created, we'll run some queries that will tell us the number of coffee shops in each neighborhood and the closest coffee shops to a specific location.
